* Calculate the magnetic fields generated by a set of coaxial circular current loops.

notice: In Jackson's book, eq.(5.37) is wrong. For elliptic function on the numerator,
        they should be E(k\*\*2) and K(k\*\*2), but not the E(k) and K(k)

        the derivations of Br and Bz are in sympy_derive.py
